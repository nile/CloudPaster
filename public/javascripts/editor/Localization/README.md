MooEditable Localization
========================

The file MooEditable.English.US.example.js is an example locale file as reference for non US English translators. Do not use this file.

By default, MooEditable is localized to US English, without dependency on [MooTools.lang](http://mootools.net/docs/more/Core/Lang). MooTools.lang is only required when using the localization files to add additional languages.
